  {
    question: "What counts as an export?",
    answer: "An export is when you download your finished map as an SVG or PNG file. You can create and preview as many maps as you like without using your export quota."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    answer: "Yes, you can cancel your Pro subscription at any time. You'll keep Pro access until the end of your billing period."
  },
  {
    question: "What file formats can I export?",
    answer: "TopoStory exports maps as SVG (vector) or PNG (raster) files. SVG is recommended for professional printing as it scales to any size without losing quality."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer refunds?",
    answer: "If you're not satisfied with Pro within the first 14 days, contact us for a full refund. No questions asked."
  }
